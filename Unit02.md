**Unit 2: Human Development during the Schooling Years** <span
id="2"></span> 

*In this unit, we will explore human development theories, focusing
mainly on the years of formal education—pre-kindergarten through high
school. We will look at growth and development in the following areas:
physical, cognitive, linguistic, emotional, social, and moral. (And
remember, in a classroom full of students, all of these areas are in
flux at all times—and not at the same rate or pace in each child!)*  
  
 *The idea behind studying development is that if you are aware of
patterns or stages of development, you can design teaching and
management strategies that will maximize results while minimizing
problems. For instance, if you understand what is emotionally and
cognitively important to young children, you can plan and speak in ways
that will engage them in a new learning activity. Or, if you understand
what sorts of physical, social, and emotional processes are going on in
young teenagers, you can plan activities that keep them focused and
prevent embarrassment or upset feelings.*  
  
 *We will first look at cognitive development. Mental processes are the
most important element of learning, so we need to get a firm grasp of
how the mind develops and how it works at various ages. (Does this seem
to be a constructivist attitude about learning, emphasizing brain and
mind and cognitive processes? For the most part, you would be correct in
this assumption!)*  
  
 *Then we will look at social development, especially in the schooling
years. After all, students are social and emotional beings, and their
attitudes and skills change over time. Educators need to be able to
identify what their students are feeling about themselves and about each
other, and to what they are socially and emotionally able to respond.
This will help in planning and teaching, as well as in managing the
atmosphere of the classroom.*  
  
 *We will next look at moral development. Some argue that this area of
development has no relationship to schooling and that it should be
handled by family, community, religion, etc. However, when you put a
group of learners into a single space, there are bound to be situations
that demand moral and ethical decision making, from both the teacher and
students. Think back to your own years in school. You can probably
remember issues of fairness, justice, caring, and honesty, among others.
Educators should be able to recognize what their students are capable of
thinking, feeling, and doing in this area. (By the way, there is a
difference between morals and ethics: look up the difference if you
aren’t certain about the distinction. Once you do, you might then think
about how classroom situations can be handled from either one
perspective or the other.)*  
  
 *Finally, we will look at two big issues in modern society, and in our
schools: how children can gain resilience in the face of hardships of
all kinds, and how bullies and psychopaths affect the classroom.*  
  
 *Those of you familiar with the field might find this unit a review.
However, regardless of your background, you should emerge from this unit
with a stronger understanding of development theories. In later units,
you will find that this understanding can be applied toward more
effective teaching and better classroom management.*

    children in preschool programs. With some states and local areas

     Instructions: This is the stage of Erikson’s theory that applies to
    most elementary school grades and some middle-school students as
    well. It is important to understand what is going on in learners’
    inner lives at this stage, as learning can be affected by the

     Instructions: The reading provides a general overview of one of the
    more recent theories in adult development: Emerging Adulthood. This
    unique theoretical perspective was pioneered by the works of Dr.
    Arnett. As you peruse this material, consider the role of the other
    stages of psychosocial development and their impact on the stages
    that emerge in adulthood. Is the theory as fluid as Erikson noted?

     Instructions: Here is a video on Gilligan’s construct of moral
    development. Did the author of the video make a mistake in the

     Instructions: Please read this article. It provides background
    information on bullying in schools.  
        
     While there is no cited evidence that bullying is related to
    psychopathy, you might consider the bully’s mindset, as a bully
    seems to enjoy causing distress and suffering and does so without
    empathy or remorse. (Consider these questions: Are all bullies
    psychopaths? Are all psychopaths bullies?)
