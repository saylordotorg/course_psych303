**Unit 7: Planning** <span id="7"></span> 

*This unit will explore the ways educators plan for instruction and
learning. And once again we need to review Bloom’s Taxonomy. But
first….*  
 *    
 *Let’s talk about backward design. This is a concept that sets a tone
and a sequence for planning. Here’s how it works:*  
       
 *We start at the end, asking the question, “What do we want the
students to know or be able to do at the end of this learning sequence
that they did not know or could not do previously?” That will help us
establish goals for learning.*  
     
 *Next, we take our general goals and turn them into specific
objectives. This is where the taxonomy will come in handy, and you will
see why later. Objectives are particular behaviors that can be observed
and/or measured, and we spell out one or more objectives for every
goal.*  
     
 *Then we start planning. At this point, some teachers plan lessons and
activities that match each objective. (There might be two or more
objectives covered in a single activity, or it might take more than one
activity to cover a single objective.) Teachers then plan assessment
activities so students can prove they have met the objectives—on a test,
a written composition, a project, etc.*  
     
 *Other teachers start planning by setting up their assessments first.
Each assessment will cover one or more of the objectives. Then they plan
activities that get students ready for the assessments. You can’t get
more backward than that!*  
     
 *So are we done? No, because now we have to look over the objectives
and activities and assessments and decide how to accommodate all the
diversity represented in the classroom. Remember diversity? Remember how
there are diverse cultures and subcultures, diverse learning styles and
preferences, diverse abilities and disabilities? All these things must
be considered, so that every student can be appropriately challenged.*  
     
 *Done yet? No; now we have to look for resources. Will some or all
students need access to the Internet to fulfill the objectives? Will
there be a need for reading material? What range of difficulty must be
present in the reading material? Will it help to bring in community
experts, or to send students out into the community? Is there a field
trip that might help? Is there some special equipment that could be
borrowed, rented, or constructed? Will students need a special space or
clothing for some activities? Will this list ever end? Not until you’ve
considered every possible need.*  
     
 *And, we are still not done, according to some teachers, because there
is a critical step that should be included in the plan: How will
students connect this learning sequence, this new knowledge, with what
they already know? What can be put into the plan to help learners make
connections with previous knowledge? And, for that matter, how do we
determine what students already know? Can we assume they only know what
we have taught them in the past? Or, is it possible they arrive with
some incomplete knowledge about this new topic, and we should strive to
help them fill in gaps and misunderstandings? So, we add this element,
too.*  
     
 *There! Now we have a plan.**

     Instructions: You previously viewed a portion of this video in a
    previous section of this course examining what RTI is and its
    influence on classroom practices in identifying students with need.
    You will finish the video in this subtopic to examine the importance
    in creating effective goals and objectives to provide appropriate
    instructional interventions. Early intervention means more chances
    for success and less need for special education services.
