**Unit 6: Encouraging Complex Thinking** <span id="6"></span> 

*Back in Unit 1, you were introduced to Bloom’s Taxonomy of cognitive
skills. Now it is time to re-visit this idea, because this new unit is
all about getting students to go beyond memorizing or comprehending
material. What is beyond? The taxonomy answers that question. Beyond
involves complex cognitive processes—that is, mental explorations and
manipulations. For instance:*

-   *Analysis, which can be as simple as finding contrasts between two
    things or ideas, or as complex as describing the inner structure or
    workings of a poem, a novel, or a machine*
-   *Judgment, which involves setting up criteria and holding something
    up to scrutiny to see how it measures against the criteria, whether
    it is judging the value of a piece of literature, the elegance of
    a math formula, or the practicality of an architectural design*
-   *Creation, which involves finding new uses for objects, or
    recombining elements to come up with a new design or invention or
    plan*

*(You might say that I have just used terms and a sequence that don’t
quite match the taxonomy, but I have! Do a web search for the updated
taxonomy, as described by Bloom’s disciples Anderson and Krathwohl.)*  
     
 *When it comes to classroom practices that encourage these kinds of
thought behaviors, teachers have many resources at their disposal. But
first, they must make some important distinctions—and so must you. Do
you want students to engage in creative or critical thinking? (And,
what’s the difference?) Do you want to give them well-defined or
ill-defined problems to solve? (And, what is the advantage of each?) Do
you want them to solve problems by well-established steps or through
trial-and-error? Do you want them to be led mostly by the teacher and a
syllabus or curriculum, or do you want them to define their own learning
path? Do you want them to work independently or in teams? How much
guidance is necessary for student success? (And, what are those
skills?)*  
     
 *Think about these questions as you delve into Unit 6.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐   Subunit 6.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐   Subunit 6.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐   Subunit 6.3: 2 hours  
  
 ☐   Subunit 6.4: 3 hours  
  
 ☐   Unit Assignment: 1 hour

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:

-   define, compare, and contrast critical thinking, creative thinking,
    and problem-solving;
-   discuss components of critical thinking (including metacognition)
    and strategies by which teachers can enhance critical thinking
    abilities;
-   discuss components of problem-solving and strategies by which
    teachers can enhance problem-solving skills; and
-   compare and contrast types of teacher-directed and student-directed
    learning, and discuss scenarios in which each type might be
    effective.

     Instructions: This video introduces the instructional method known
    as cooperative learning. This usually entails groups of learners
    working as a team, although the team can comprise as few as two
    people. Some teachers think this method will take care of all
    student needs, from diversity of learning styles to special learning
    needs. It is erroneous (and lazy) to think this way, because
    learners cannot always accommodate each other or automatically bring
    out the best in each other. Only a teacher can do all these things
    and hopefully train learners to try to do them with each other.
    Think about aspects of Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory and their
    relevance to effective cooperative learning.
