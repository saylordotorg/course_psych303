**Unit 4: Student Motivation** <span id="4"></span> 

*This unit will explore the ways that educators motivate their students
to learn and strive for excellence. We will look at motivation theories
that place varying emphasis on teacher and student input. Then we will
examine a model that integrates elements of those theories.*  
 *    
 *When you think about motivating students, you come to a crossroad: do
you employ behavioristic theories and methods, relying on mostly
external rewards and punishments, or do you employ constructivist
theories and models, addressing intrinsic motivation in your students?
This is how you can divide most theories and methods—by judging whether
they emphasize extrinsic or intrinsic motivators. Of course, it gets
more complicated than that….*  
     
 *In a behaviorist model, the teacher sets up an extrinsic reward system
to motivate students to comply or achieve. The rewards might be tokens
to be exchanged for prizes, stars on a chart, or grades. But, however it
is done, you’ll notice that the teacher is in charge; the teacher is the
judge and paymaster. Everyone has to focus on what the teacher wants and
expects in order to earn the reward. After a while, a teacher might find
that students actually expect a reward for performing simple tasks, and
they might not want to comply unless they can get something in return.
Now the bargaining begins—in a place where love of learning is supposed
to rule!*  
     
 *In a constructivist model, the teacher has to dig deep to find the
right intrinsic motivator—sometimes a slightly different motivator for
different children. And that’s not surprising, when you think about it.
Abraham Maslow described the pathway to full personality as an ongoing
search to fulfill internal needs. Individuals seek basic survival needs,
and when those are met, they seek relationship and companionship. And
when those needs are met…. Well, you get the idea, and there will be
reading and videos to help you. Now, imagine a student who comes to your
classroom hungry, another who comes in lonely, and another who comes in
thirsting for knowledge and challenge—very different motivators at work!
(And by the way, Maslow had a long career as a researcher and thinker.
When you know about his hierarchy of needs, you have learned only a
fraction of what he thought and wrote about.)*  
     
 *So, a teacher who wants to motivate intrinsically has to find what
motivates various students. This search for students’ internal
motivators can be both challenging and rewarding. There’s a famous
researcher and writer, Jere Brophy, who literally wrote the book on
these matters—actually, more than one, and you might want to read some
of his work if this topic intrigues you. He recognized that there are
many ways to motivate students intrinsically, and we’ll be looking at
some of them.*  
     
 *Surprise and curiosity can be great motivators, especially at the
beginning of a learning unit. Imagine a history teacher coming into the
room dressed as Abraham Lincoln, or a science teacher who seems to be
able to make colored liquids instantly! Those sorts of performances
quickly arouse student interest. But of course, the teacher had better
follow up with other motivating activities once the novelty and surprise
wear off….*  
     
 *Another motivator is helping students see relevance—relationships
between what they are learning and something that is important to them
personally. (How often has a teacher suggested that it’s important to
learn something because “you’ll need it in the future”—without taking
the time to describe HOW it can be used in the future. Frustrating,
isn’t it?)*  
     
 *Then there are motivators that get students to be their own learning
monitors: helping them set learning goals for themselves, rather than
having to learn only what the teacher puts in a syllabus or an
assignment sheet. This can also apply to setting goals for better work
habits or social behaviors. The idea is to get students involved in
finding their own reasons for picking up a topic and running with
it—especially when they can decide the direction and speed of the
run!*  
     
 *The final model we will look at is rather sophisticated: Expectancy x
Value. In a nutshell, it is a model that combines the concept of
anticipation of reward (extrinsic or intrinsic) with the concept of
judging how much it is worth the effort to get the reward. The textbook
should help you get a grip on this.**

     Instructions: This video provides an overview of the main tenets of
    Dr. Carol Dweck’s theory of the Growth Mindset and Motivation. Dr.
    Dweck argues that students’ motivation to learn is greatly impacted
    by their own understanding of their individual learning and
    performance characteristics (e.g., whether fixed or malleable).
    Other work by Dr. Dweck emphasizes this as the performance-oriented
    mindset vs. the mastery-oriented mindset, which significantly
    impacts the types of goals learners set for themselves. Consider the
    role of this thinking pattern and student outcomes.
