**Unit 3: Understanding Diversity** <span id="3"></span> 

*This unit will explore the ways in which educators acknowledge and
accommodate uniqueness in learners. This is an important topic in modern
education: partly because of changing diversity of learners, and partly
because of renewed emphasis on opportunity and achievement for all
students.*  
     
 *First, we will look at diversity in terms of how students differ in
their personal and group backgrounds. This includes differences in
learning styles, intelligence modes, gender, cultures, and language.
Imagine a classroom of nine year olds. Although they are the same age,
each child has a unique blend of abilities and preferences in the
learning process. One child is a boy who is highly verbal and learns
best by listening—but he is still learning English, having arrived from
Central America less than a year ago. Another child is a girl who talks
very little and learns best by thinking quietly to herself about an
answer—and she gets nervous and distracted by people talking near her.
Now imagine 18 to 24 other children in the room, each with a unique set
of needs and preferences and talents. Somehow, a teacher must help each
one learn to his/her maximum ability. How is this to be done? We won’t
try to answer that question in this unit, but we will begin to consider
the possible variances within and among any given group of children.*  
     
 *This first kind of diversity also includes differences in
sub-cultures, because student attitudes and performance can be
influenced by regional and socio-economic differences. Here’s an example
to consider: Imagine an African-American child living in an affluent
northern United States metropolitan suburb. Does this child have more in
common with the Caucasian child living down the street or with an
African-American child living in the rural southern part of the country?
What is the basis of your answer?*  
     
 *After looking at differences in circumstance and personal preferences,
we will look at diversity in terms of disabilities that individual
students might exhibit. Disabilities can include impairments in
physical, emotional, or cognitive functioning—and sometimes a
combination of these. In the past, such children might spend part or all
of the school day in classrooms that catered exclusively to special
needs students. But today, with much emphasis on the concept of
inclusion, it is likely that these children will attend school in
regular classrooms with the direct and/or indirect support of certified
special education teachers who follow each student’s Individualized
Education Plan (IEP).*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to

    differences, such as differences in learning styles and preferences,
    intelligences and sensitivities, cultures and ethnicities, and
    gender; and

    IEPs and alternative assessment; and the categories of disabilities:
    learning, cognitive, sensory, behavioral, and physical.

     Instructions: This is the first of several videos that point out
    the vast diversity in terms of thinking and learning that can be
    present in a classroom. Learners can differ in many ways, and still
    be considered *normal*. And some learners will have *special
    needs—*meaning that their learning abilities are so different from
    others as to require special instruction, curriculum, equipment,
    etc.

     Instructions: This video provides insight into how experts are
    looking at the many issues that arise when classrooms include
    students from diverse cultural backgrounds. Note that respect and
    honoring of cultures goes far beyond recognizing the holidays and
    foods of others: it might even need to include how to talk to
    learners, what to expect of them, and issues of pride, inclusion and
    alienation, self-esteem, safety, and curriculum decisions.

    differences fostered by differing socio-economic statuses (SES).
    Economic *class* differences can be striking with regard to

    schools, the *culture* of religion comes with each child into the
    classroom, and often with the teacher as well. It is important to

     Instructions: The question and answer series listed above provides
    many of the answers sought by educators in relation to Response to
    Intervention (RTI). Whether a content area teacher or intervention
    specialist, this information will provide the background needed in
    understanding the importance of this legislative change in
    identifying of children with special needs. Additionally, RTI is a
    tiered process of instruction that allows schools to identify
    struggling students early and provide appropriate instructional
    interventions. Early intervention means more chances for success and
    less need for special education services.  RTI would also address
    the needs of children who previously did not qualify for special
    education.
