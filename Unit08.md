**Unit 8: Assessment** <span id="8"></span> 

*This unit will explore the ways educators assess students to determine
if and how much learning has taken place. In some ways, this unit is
just a continuation of Unit 7, because after the planning and the
execution of the plan, there must be some way for the teacher to
determine students’ success in meeting the plan goals and objectives.*  
 *    
 *We will start with teacher-made assessments—all the ways teachers can
measure progress and understanding. There are all sorts of complications
in this. For instance, if you design a multiple-choice test, should you
give students three or four choices per question? Why would it matter?
What about true-false questions? How much guessing might take place,
since there is always a 50% chance of getting a right answer? How do you
assess or grade an essay? What makes one essay better than another?
Should spelling and grammar count on a social studies essay? Should
neatness count on a math test of algebra proofs? As you can see, if you
don’t start with a clear idea of what you want to assess—your
criteria—you can fall into all sorts of traps and biases. Then consider
that a student might do well on one kind of test, but poorly on another.
That student’s neighbor might have just the opposite tendencies! What is
and is not fair?*  
     
 *We will also consider how teachers can analyze the results of their
assessments to improve future instruction. This gives you to an
introduction to action research—analyzing your own performance and your
students’ successes and failures. This is done with the intent of
improving your planning and instruction in the future.*  
     
 *Lastly, we will look at standardized testing. There are many forms,
such as those that measure students’ intelligence, or their mastery of
state-mandated goals and objectives.  Some tests assign students to an
academic track, while others determine if students are academically fit
to move to the next grade level or to graduate.*  
     
 *There are two main areas to address on this topic:** *How to read and
interpret individual and group statistics of test results, and then use
the results to improve planning and instruction; and, awareness of
shortcomings and controversies surrounding the various types of
standardized tests.*
