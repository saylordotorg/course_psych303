**Unit 1: Introduction and Two Major Views of Learning** <span
id="1"></span> 

This first unit will cover the first two chapters in the textbook. The
first chapter provides an overview of the purposes and uses of
educational psychology, trying to answer the question: “What can
educators get out of studying psychology, especially a branch that
devotes itself to teaching and learning?” I hope that you will get a
sense of the enormous responsibility every teacher has, and how this
branch of psychology can make a difference in this discipline.  
  
 The second chapter will introduce you to the two major categories in
the psychology of learning: behaviorism (sometimes known as learning
theory) and constructivism (also known as cognitive psychology). The
differences between the two are summarized below:

-   Behaviorists say that knowledge cannot be directly seen or measured;
    only behavior can be seen and measured, so it should be the focus of
    education. Behaviors are learned from the environment (called
    stimuli). In other words, humans learn because something (or
    someone) in the outer environment induces or causes learning by
    getting the learner to perform new behaviors. It might involve
    providing an example for the learner to imitate, or it might involve
    providing a reward when the learner performs a certain behavior.
-   Many educational goals involve behaviors that can be controlled by
    environmental factors. (Think of how you might use imitation or
    rewards to train a young child to say “please” or how you might get
    an older child to hit a ball or to memorize math facts.) Because
    there are so many learning situations that can be accomplished
    through behaviorist theory and methods, it is important for
    educators to understand why and how behaviorism
    works. Constructivists use cognitive psychology to explain learning
    from the learner’s perspective. They say that knowledge results from
    complex internal cognitive processes, rather than external
    environmental stimuli. They say that although we cannot observe
    knowledge or understanding taking place in the brain, we can make
    reasonable assumptions about what is occurring, and often we can get
    people to verbalize their thought processes about how they have
    learned. Cognitive psychologists study such things as how we
    determine solutions to social and academic problems, how we store
    information, and how we use that information in novel ways. Then
    they try to show how all these mental tricks can be done more
    efficiently and productively in the learning process. This is
    especially important for educators, because they are always
    interested in how to maximize their instructional efforts, and they
    want their learners to get the most out of every learning
    experience. 

Behaviorism and constructivism appear to oppose one another. One
approaches learning as the consequence of individuals performing
whatever behavior it takes to get a pleasant result, while the other
defines learning as a complex series of mental gymnastics. In fact,
neither theory can account for all types of learning under all
conditions. In the real world, educators find both learning theories
applicable in different settings. As a result, it is important to
understand their principles and applications here at the beginning,
since these two perspectives will reappear throughout the course. You
will see evidence of behaviorism and constructivism in topics regarding
classroom instruction as well as in topics on behavior management.

    behavioral psychology;

**1.3 Major Theories and Models about Learning** <span id="1.3"></span> 
**1.3.1 Behaviorism (Learning Theory)** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 

Within this subunit, we explore the eldest learning theory, Behaviorism.
There is much debate about the relevance of Behaviorism to current
educational learning theory; however, many classroom teachers, school
psychologists, and administrators continue to use their knowledge of
this theory to attempt to explain specific student behaviors. The
following resources will highlight two fundamental models of learning by
behaviorists: Classical (Respondent) Conditioning and Operant
Conditioning. By the conclusion of this subunit, you should have a firm
grasp on the major premise of Behaviorism: learning can only be noted if
there is an observable change in a student’s behavior. Pay attention to
this aspect, as it will differ significantly from the theory of
Constructivism. 

**1.3.1.1 Classical (Respondent) Conditioning** <span

    Albert”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt0ucxOrPQE) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Watch the video about John Watson and classical
    conditioning. Consider how this type of behaviorism can or could be
    used in schools (in more humane ways, of course).

    Reinforcement”**

    Reinforcement”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfraBsz9gX4)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video attempts to clear up a very misunderstood
    aspect of operant conditioning. Although negative reinforcement is
    not the same as positive reinforcement, there are similarities. And
    more importantly, it is not the same as punishment! Think about how
    this confusion among negative reinforcement and punishment has
    developed over time and its role in classroom management.

     Instructions: After reviewing the unit materials and completing the
    assessment, consider completing the following activity and then post
    your findings on the course discussion board. Feel free to start
    your own related posts and respond to other students’ postings, as
    well. If you haven’t already done so, you will need to create a free
    account at the link above to participate in the discussions.  
        
     1. Find examples of adults using behaviorist principles with
    children or students in everyday life. This might include verbal
    praise and rewards for a job well done, negative reinforcement, or
    the “Premack” principle. You may also see examples of behaviors that
    do not conform to behaviorist principles such as “bribes” **before**
    the expected behavior (e.g. “If I give you this candy now do you
    promise to be good”). Good places to see behaviorism in everyday
    life are school sporting events (observe how the parents and coaches
    talk to the kids); parents and kids waiting in line in supermarkets
    and other shops; parents and students interacting in toy stores; and
    classrooms. You should include at least **three** incidents.  
        
     2. For each incident, write a description of where you observed
    (e.g., supermarket Friday at 6:00pm), who (e.g., adult women and
    child 2-3 years old) you observed, the actual observational details,
    and an analysis of the behavioral principle you believe the observed
    behavior illustrates.
