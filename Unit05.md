**Unit 5: Classroom Management and Communication** <span id="5"></span> 

*This unit will explore the ways that educators manage learning
environments to maximize learning and social cohesion. We will first
look at strategies that prevent misbehavior; these are the things
teachers do to keep students focused on learning. They include such
elements as:*

-   *organization of the physical space, so that everyone has space to
    work and move;*
-   *well-defined procedures and routines, such as where to find spare
    pencils, where to turn in work, or how to clean up and leave the
    room; and*
-   *rules for acceptable work and behavior, such as how to get the
    teacher’s attention, how much talking or helping is allowed, or
    consequences for late work.*

*Keeping students focused on learning also involves teacher behaviors.
These are the verbal and non-verbal actions that let students know that
the teacher is aware of the entire learning environment—what students
are doing, and how they are feeling. (Did you ever have a teacher who
talked while facing the board or projector screen, instead of facing the
students? That’s a big, fat no-no!) And another important strategy: keep
things moving. Don’t let the pace of learning get interrupted or jerky.
Don’t allow holes or cracks in the flow that might invite students to
exit to dreamland or misbehavior!*  
     
 *Then it will be time to focus on what to do when misbehavior has
occurred. An effective teacher will deal with this in an efficient and
fair way. To do this, some teachers use a one size fits all method. This
might be considered the best way to make it seem fair, but don’t you
wonder if every student and every misbehavior can or should be treated
the same in the name of fairness?*  
     
 *Some effective teachers have a variety of techniques, each to fit you
and the occasion. They might include these strategies: *

-   *Ignore the minor stuff and praise those who are doing the right
    thing. That might get everyone interested in joining the praise
    parade.*
-   *Walk over to the students who are starting to misbehave and just
    stand VERY close by.*
-   *Make eye contact with anyone misbehaving. Add a frown or shake of
    the head for added effect.*
-   *Make the misbehaving student apologize, then move on.*
-   *Spend time with the misbehaving student after the lesson, and issue
    logical consequences for his/her actions. (What’s logical? Read the
    textbook and watch the videos for ideas.)*
-   *If it involves a conflict between two students, let them work it
    out, but not during the learning time or your instructional time.*

*Our last topic in this unit is a broad one: how to communicate with and
to students. This includes how to convey expectations without talking
down to students. And, it includes how to encourage students to
participate in discussions, so that everyone feels welcome to
contribute. Lastly, we will explore the modern topic of a caring
classroom community—a concept of the classroom as a place where everyone
is welcome, supported, and cared for. It also includes the notion that
the classroom’s physical as well as emotional environment is worth
protecting and enhancing.*  
     
 *The concepts of caring and community might seem to be a topic mostly
for elementary grades, but consider the social and emotional lives of
teenagers. Even if they meet only in one-hour classes, there can still
be a sense of community that can be nurtured—a temporary caring
environment that will bring out the best in everyone.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link, scroll down to the Table of
    Contents, and then click “8: The Nature of Classroom Communication.”
    This reading introduces the topic of motivation in schools and
    covers many important aspects of classroom management such as

    -   effective communication including non-verbal communication;
    -   encouraging participation;
    -   using talk to deepen thinking and learning; and
    -   encouraging a caring classroom and community.

    As you read the Chapter 8 of Seifert and Sutton, consider the ways
    you can use non-verbal communication such as body language and
    facial expressions to send messages to students. Additionally,
    consider how powerful the act of inflecting voice and using
    proximity with students is to managing behaviors. Sometimes much can
    be said without saying anything at all.
