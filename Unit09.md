**Unit 9: The Psychology of the Teacher** <span id="9"></span> 

*In this final unit, we will explore how teachers cope with their roles
and responsibilities. Consider the routine, the stress, the school
climate. Then consider how each teacher enters the profession at a
certain age and life stage, with certain ideals, and how aging, personal
matters, career longevity, and experience can change one’s perspective
and outlook. Finally, consider that in the midst of all the fore
mentioned, every teacher is supposed to be committed to career
growth—whatever that means. So what does it mean?*  
 *    
 *For the beginning teacher, career growth is probably just a matter of
survival—learning what does and doesn’t work, learning how to get along
with peers, superiors, students, and parents. Not much else will matter
during the first years. Experts know that, and there are well-known,
well-researched interventions to help beginning teachers make it through
and find their comfort zone.*  
     
 *For the more experienced teacher, career growth will probably involve
learning and trying new techniques. It might also involve branching out
by taking college courses or switching to teach a different course or
age group.*  
     
 *For the mature teacher, career growth can mean just hanging on until
retirement, or it can mean becoming a well-respected member of the
staff—perhaps mentoring others, or publishing in his/her specialized
field. What makes the difference between these two scenarios?*  
     
 *(I’m sure every teacher who became weary, grouchy, or resistant to
change entered the profession vowing never to be like those weary,
grouchy, uncaring teachers they once had!)*  
       
 *Every teacher is a unique person and works within unique
circumstances. However, we can learn some general principles based on
research dealing with teacher stress and longevity.**

     Instructions: Please read the article on the role of emotion labor
    and teachers’ emotions and their interactions with students. This
    original piece by Hargreave was monumental in catapulting the field
    of teacher’s emotions and the importance in identifying the role of
    teachers’ emotion in students learning as well.

     Instructions: Please watch the video by teachers on stress and
    coping mechanisms. Every experienced teacher has developed
    techniques for stress management, and these show only a sampling of
    what is being used. You might expand on these videos by interviewing
    teachers yourself.

     Instructions: Please click on the link, scroll down to the Table of
    Contents, and then click “Appendix C: Types of Resources for
    Professional Development.” Read this section and the section titled
    “Reading and Understanding Professional Articles.” Professional
    development is a major part (but not the whole) of what is involved
    in school climate and collegiality, but since many forms of
    professional development involve entire school staffs or subject
    area or grade level teams, this reading is appropriate for this
    subunit. This file is large and may take a while to load fully.
